<p>
<h3>Create a Virtual Machine on Azure</h3>

<be><br>
  
- The first step is to create a Virtual Machine (VM) on Azure.
- Create a Resource Group - osTicket
- Choose Windows 10 Pro, version 22H2.
- Set the size to 2 or 4 vcpus and 16 GiB memory. I chose 4 vcpus for better performance.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/756a4c35-ae2b-49c2-98b3-1e72874e57fc)
<br><br>

- Confirm that RDP (3389) is allowed in "Select inbound ports" to allow Remote Desktop access to the VM.</strong>
- Click on the last check box to confirm a Windows 10 license, then proceed to "Review + Create". A validation process will occur before being able to create.

<h3>Connect to your VM via the Remote Desktop Connection</h3>
